                  We offer interchangeability and very close dimensional tolerances of all our parts so that the end customer is able to conduct preventive and breakdown maintenance of their equipment easily. HSS Fittings are manufactured:

                <p className='mt-3'>
                  Incomplete compliance of international standards such as ISO 8434. We have the technical know-how and design capability for the same.

                <p className='mt-3'>
                  GO and NO GO gauges are maintained for thread and bore. We at HSS, have invested heavily in quality assurance equipment and each fitting is inspected 100% dimensionally and with thread and bore gauges before dispatch.

                  HSS products offer best in class Chromium Free Zinc Plating with Trivalent Passivation for C.S. products with thickness of 8-12 microns on both the outer and inner surfaces with minimum salt spray life of 248 Hours. On request we can provide plating with upto 400 hours of SST life. We get third party inspection every month from accredited lab to test the Salt Spray Life.

                  HSS offers Type-P design of Swivel coupling has a Thrust wire pin resulting in zero chances of ferrule slipping over the tube under pressure, thus the joint is positive and safe.

                  Where ever a Rubber at seal or a O-Ring is used in a HSS fitting, extra care is taken to provide a smooth seat finish without any roughness or turning lines otherwise it may damage the rubber seal or O-Ring and leakage may start after some time
                </p>
                <p className='mt-3'>All Rubber parts being used in our range of ttings have a shelf life. We not only use the best raw material for this important hydraulic part but also keep a track of its expiry date. Expired O-Ring breaks or starts leaking while doing assembly / Testing
                </p>
                <p className='mt-3'>Every fitting / Hose is being cleaned with cleaning solvents & blow pressurized air so that dust / foreign particles or iron particles may not enter the hydraulic circuit and may not damage / block the passage of your costly hydraulic equipment.
