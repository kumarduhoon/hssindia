              Low-pressure couplings for applications with low pressure can be swaged with ferrules or assembled with hose clamps. As a further customer service, we can also offer pre-assembled hoses with couplings. The couplings are available in materials such as brass, aluminum, stainless steel, steel, and polypropylene.
